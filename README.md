### Attempt at for-Focus & Feel Good Music Remix Script
### The idea relies largely on usage of prime number patterns to achieve a neat melodic effect. Here's my favorite song with it: 
### https://mur0110.github.io/mur/psasr.html

## More details on implementation:

### Generate, independently, modifications of 5, 7, 8, or 11 % on the volume or tempo of a given song interval. 

[Notice 5, 7, 11 are primes, 8 is the sum of nextdoor primes 3, 5 and to me adds a subtle dimension being just 1 from nearest]

### -> Apply these to (3, 5, or 7) factor of duration stretch, continuing simply 3, 5, 7, 3, 5, 7 

[Notice these are consecutive primes within 2 of another. I think it's critical that these primes exist at a portion of the number line where they both are fixed offset and quickly scale from 3 to 7 so more than 2x in +2 spaces]
